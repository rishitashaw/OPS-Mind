I was unable to reproduce this at all on my Windows development box running the latest RELEASE_1_0_BRANCH and with patches for ROL-554, Tomcat 5.0.28, Sun JDK 1.4.2_06.

I WAS, however, able to reproduce this on my Linux staging box running RedHat ES3, Sun JDK 1.4.2_05, Tomcat 5.0.28.

I am still looking into it further.",2004-12-17 18:44:19,2004-12-17 18:44:19

BEEHIVE-427,62776,653f8212,"I misunderstood this the first time I looked at it (well, maybe I'm still misunderstanding :)).  This seems like it's working correctly to me.  Controller.jpf *isn't* getting any sort of automatic reference to the shared flow.  The nested page flow is passing back a form bean, and that form bean happens to be an instance of a static inner class of the shared flow, but that's fine.  It's the same as using any other static inner class.

If I'm missing the point of this, feel free to reopen.",2005-04-14 08:09:46,2005-04-14 08:09:46

BEEHIVE-288,59051,653f8212,"Right, the problem is with the implementation of Sun's Mirror APIs within apt (the annotation processing tool).  Because it's not always the case that someAnnotation.equals(anotherAnnotation), where someAnnotation and anotherAnnotation are actually the *same*, just retrieved different ways... I have a workaround that compares annotations by recursively comparing all their attributes.  So I can't distinguish between the two totally-duplicated annotations.

I think my action on this will be to file a bug with Sun, but I first need to check if this was fixed in the latest JDK update.",2005-02-12 08:32:43,2005-02-12 08:32:43
